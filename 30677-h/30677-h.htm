<h2>JOHN JAMES AUDUBON.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 53px;">
<img src="images/imgj.png" width="53" height="80" alt="J" title="" />
</div>
<p>OHN JAMES AUDUBON has
always been a favorite with
the writer, for the invincibleness
of his love of Nature and
of birds is only equalled by
the spontaneous freshness of his style,
springing from an affectionate and joyous
nature. Recently there was found
by accident, in an old calf-skin bound
volume, an autobiography of the
naturalist. It is entitled &ldquo;Audubon&#8217;s
Story of his Youth,&rdquo; and would make
a very pretty book. As introductory
to the diaries and ornithological
biographies of the birds, it would be
very useful.</p>

<p>Two or three incidents in the life of
this fascinating character are interesting
as showing the influence of the
accidental in ultimate achievement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One incident,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;which is
as perfect in my memory as if it had
occurred this very day, I have thought
thousands of times since, and will now
put on paper as one of the curious
things which perhaps did lead me in
after times to love birds, and to finally
study them with pleasure infinite. My
mother had several beautiful parrots,
and some monkeys; one of the latter
was a full-grown male of a very large
species. One morning, while the
servants were engaged in arranging
the room I was in, &lsquo;Pretty Polly&rsquo;
asking for her breakfast as usual,
&lsquo;<em>Du pain au lait pour le perroquet
Mignonne</em>,&rsquo; (bread and milk for the parrot
Mignonne,) the man of the woods
probably thought the bird presuming
upon his rights in the scale of nature;
be this as it may, he certainly showed
his supremacy in strength over the
denizen of the air, for, walking
deliberately and uprightly toward the
poor bird, he at once killed it, with
unnatural composure. The sensations
of my infant heart at this cruel sight
were agony to me. I prayed the
servant to beat the monkey, but he,
who for some reason, preferred the
monkey to the parrot, refused. I
uttered long and piercing cries, my
mother rushed into the room; I was
tranquilized; the monkey was forever
afterward chained, and Mignonne
buried with all the pomp of a cherished
lost one. This made, as I have said, a
very deep impression on my youthful
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In consequence of the long absences
of his father, who was an admiral in
the French navy, the young naturalist&#8217;s
education was neglected, his mother
suffering him to do much as he pleased,
and it was not to be wondered at, as
he says, that instead of applying closely
to his studies, he preferred associating
with boys of his own age and disposition,
who were more fond of going
in search of bird&#8217;s nests, fishing, or shooting,
than of better studies. Thus almost
every day, instead of going to school,
he usually made for the fields where
he spent the day, returning with his
little basket filled with what he called
curiosities, such as birds&#8217; nests, birds&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
eggs, curious lichens, flowers of all
sorts, and even pebbles gathered along
the shore of some rivulet. Nevertheless,
he did study drawing and music,
for which he had some talent. His subsequent
study of drawing under the
celebrated David, richly equipped him
for a work which he did not know
was ever to be his, and enabled him to
commence a series of drawings of birds
of France, which he continued until
he had upwards of two hundred completed.
&ldquo;All bad enough,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;yet they were representations of birds,
and I felt pleased with them.&rdquo; Before
sailing for France, he had begun a
series of drawings of the birds of
America, and had also begun a study
of their habits. His efforts were commended
by one of his friends, who
assured him the time might come
when he should be a great American
naturalist, which had such weight
with him that he felt a certain degree
of pride in the words, even then, when
he was about eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The store at Louisville went on
prosperously, when I attended to it;
but birds were birds then as now, and
my thoughts were ever and anon
turning toward them as the objects of
my greatest delight. I shot, I drew, I
looked on nature only; my days were
happy beyond human conception, and
beyond this I really cared not.&rdquo; [How
like Agassiz, who said he had not time
to make money.] As he could not bear
to give the attention required by his
business, his business abandoned him.
&ldquo;Indeed, I never thought of business
beyond the ever-engaging journeys
which I was in the habit of taking to
Philadelphia or New York, to purchase
goods; those journeys I greatly enjoyed,
as they afforded me ample means to
study birds and their habits as I
traveled through the beautiful, the
darling forests of Ohio, Kentucky, and
Pennsylvania.&rdquo; Poor fellow, how many
ups and downs he had! He lost everything
and became burdened with
debt. But he did not despair for
had he not a talent for drawing?
He at once undertook to take portraits
of the human head divine in black
chalk, and thanks to his master, David,
succeeded admirably. He established
a large drawing school at Cincinnati,
and formed an engagement to stuff
birds for the museum there at a large
salary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the most extraordinary
things among all these adverse circumstances&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;was, that I never for
a day give up listening to the songs of
our birds, or watching their peculiar
habits, or delineating them in the best
way I could; nay, during my deepest
troubles, I frequently would wrench
myself from the persons around me
and retire to some secluded part of our
noble forests; and many a time, at the
sound of the wood-thrushes&#8217; melodies,
have I fallen on my knees and there
prayed earnestly to our God. This
never failed to bring me the most
valuable of thoughts, and always comfort,
and it was often necessary for me
to exert my will and compel myself to
return to my fellow-beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you not fancy that Audubon
was himself a <em>rara avis</em> and worthy of
admiration and study?</p>

<p>Such a man, in the language of a
contemporary, should have a monument
in the old Creole country in
which he was born, and whose birds
inspired his childish visions. It should
be the most beautiful work possible to
the sculptor&#8217;s art, portraying Audubon
in the garb he wore when he was
proud and happy to be called the
&ldquo;American Woodman,&rdquo; and at his
feet should stand the Eagle which he
named the &ldquo;Bird of Washington,&rdquo; and
near should perch the Mocking Bird,
as once, in his description, it flew
and fluttered and sang to the mind&#8217;s
eye and ear from the pages of the old
reading book.</p>

<h2>THE SUMMER TANAGER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HE TANAGERS are birds of
such uncommon beauty that
when we have taken the pictures
of the entire family the
group will be a notable one and will
add attractiveness to the portfolio.
[See Vol. I, pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30221/30221-h/30221-h.htm#Page_31">31</a>
and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30666/30666-h/30666-h.htm#Page_216">216</a>.] This specimen
is also called the Summer Red-bird
or Rose Tanager, and is found
pretty generally distributed over the
United States during the summer
months, wintering in Cuba, Central
America, and northern South America.
As will be seen, the adult male is a
plain vermilion red. The plumage of
the female is less attractive. In habits
this species resembles the Scarlet Tanager,
perhaps the most brilliant of the
group, but is not so retiring, frequenting
open groves and often visiting
towns and cities.</p>

<p>The nesting season of this charming
bird extends to the latter part of July,
but varies with the latitude and season.
Bark strips and leaves interwoven with
various vegetable substances compose
the nest, which is usually built on a
horizontal or drooping branch, near
its extremity and situated at the edge
of a grove near the roadside. Davie
says: &ldquo;All the nests of this species
which I have seen collected in Ohio
are very thin and frail structures; so
thin that the eggs may often be seen
from beneath. A nest sent me from
Lee county, Texas, is compactly built
of a cottony weed, a few stems of
Spanish moss, and lined with fine
grass stems.&rdquo; Mr. L. O. Pindar states
that nests found in Kentucky are compactly
built, but not very thickly
lined. The eggs are beautiful, being
a bright, light emerald green, spotted,
dotted, and blotched with various
shades of lilac, brownish-purple, and
dark brown.</p>

<p>Chapman says the Summer Tanager
may be easily identified, not alone by
its color but by its unique call-note, a
clearly enunciated <em>chicky, tucky, tuck</em>.
Its song bears a general resemblance
to that of the Scarlet, but to some ears
is much sweeter, better sustained, and
more musical. It equals in strength,
according to one authority, that of the
Robin, but is uttered more hurriedly,
is more &ldquo;wiry,&rdquo; and much more continued.</p>

<p>The Summer Tanager is to a greater
or less extent known to farmers as the
Red Bee-Bird. Its food consists largely
of hornets, wasps, and bees.</p>

<p>The male of this species requires
several years to attain the full plumage.
Immature individuals, it is said,
show a mixture of red and yellow
in relative proportions according to
age. The female has more red than
the male, but the tint is peculiar, a
dull Chinese orange, instead of a pure
rosy vermilion, as in the male.</p>

<p>An interesting study for many of
our readers during the summer months
when the Tanagers are gay in their
full plumage, would be to seek out,
with <span class="smcap">Birds</span> in hand, the most attractive
denizens of the groves, identifying and
observing them in their haunts until
the entire group, of which five species
are represented in the United States,
is made familiar. When we remember
that there are about three hundred
and eighty known species of Tanagers
in Tropical America, it would seem a
light task to acquaint oneself with the
small family at home.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;As stupid as a Goose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I know that is the way
our family is usually spoken of.
But then I&#8217;m not a tame Goose,
you know. We wild fellows
think we know a little more than
the one which waddles about
the duck-pond in your back yard.</p>

<p>He sticks to one old place all
the time. Waddles and talks
and looks the same year after
year. We migratory birds, on
the other hand, fly from place to
place. Our summers are passed
here, our winters there; so that
we pick up a thing or two the
common Goose never dreams of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The laughing Goose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, some people call me that.
I don&#8217;t know why, unless my
<em>Honk, honk, honk!</em> sounds like a
laugh. Perhaps, though, it is
because the look about my
mouth is so pleasant.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a flock of us
in motion, in October or November,
going to our winter home?</p>

<p>Ah, that is a sight! When
the time comes for us to start,
we form ourselves into a figure
like this <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">&gt;&middot;</span> a big gander taking
the lead where the dot is.
Such a <em>honk, honk, honking</em> you
never heard. People who have
heard us, and seen us, say it
sounds like a great army overhead.</p>

<p>Where do we live in summer,
and what do we eat?</p>

<p>You will find us throughout
the whole of North America, but
in greater numbers on the Pacific
coast. The fresh-water lakes
are our favorite resorts. We
visit the wheat fields and corn
fields, nibbling the young, tender
blades and feeding on the
scattered grain. The farmers
don&#8217;t like it a bit, but we don&#8217;t
care. That is the reason our
flesh tastes so sweet.</p>

<p>And tough!</p>

<p>My, how you talk! It is only
we old fellows that are tough, we
fellows over a year old. But of
course a great many people
don&#8217;t know that, or don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>Why, I once heard of a gander
that had waddled around a
barnyard for five long years.
Thanksgiving Day arrived, and
they roasted him for dinner.</p>

<p>Think of eating an old, <em>old</em>
friend like that!</p>

<p>Where do we build our nests?</p>

<p>Away up north, in Alaska,
and on the islands of the Arctic
Sea. We make them of hay,
feathers, and down, building them
in hollow places on the ground.</p>

<p>How many eggs?</p>

<p>Six. I am very good to
my mate, and an affectionate
father.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>HITE-FRONTED or
Laughing Geese are found
in considerable numbers
on the prairies of the
Mississippi Valley. They are called
Prairie Brant by market-men and
gunners. Though not abundant on the
Atlantic seaboard, vast flocks may be
seen in the autumn months on
the Pacific Slope. In Oregon and
northern California some remain all
winter, though the greater number go
farther south. They appear to prefer
the grassy patches along streams flowing
into the ocean, or the tide-water flats
so abundant in Oregon and Washington,
where the Speckle-bellies, as they
are called, feed in company with
the Snow Geese. The nesting place
of this favorite species is in the wooded
districts of Alaska and along the
Yukon river. No nest is formed, from
seven to ten eggs being laid in a
depression in the sand.</p>

<p>It is said that notwithstanding all
references to their ungainly movement
and doltish intellect, the Wild Goose,
of which the White-fronted is one of
the most interesting, is held in high
estimation by the sportsman, and even
he, if keen of observation, will learn
from it many things that will entitle
the species to advancement in the
mental grade, and prove the truth of a
very old adage, that you cannot judge
of things by outward appearance. A
goose, waddling around the barnyard,
may not present a very graceful appearance,
nor seem endowed with much
intelligence, yet the ungainly creature,
when in its natural state, has an ease
of motion in flight which will compare
with that of any of the feathered
tribe, and shows a knowledge of the
means of defense, and of escaping the
attacks of its enemies, that few
possess. There is probably no bird
more cautious, vigilant, and fearful at
danger than this. Should their
suspicion be aroused, they rise upward
slowly in a dense cloud of white, and
sound their alarm notes, but they may
not go over fifty yards before they
alight again, so that the amusement of
watching them may be continued
without much toil or inconvenience.</p>

<p>The White-fronted Goose visits
Illinois only during its migrations,
coming some time in October or early
in November, and returning in March
or April. During its sojourn there it
frequents chiefly open prairies, or
wheat fields, where it nibbles the
young and tender blades, and cornfields,
where it feeds upon the scattered
grains. In California, Ridgway says,
it is so numerous in winter as to be
very destructive of the growing wheat
crop, and it is said that in the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys, farmers
often find it necessary to employ men
by the month to hunt and drive them
from the fields. This is most successfully
accomplished by means of brush
hiding places, or &ldquo;blinds,&rdquo; or by
approaching the flocks on horseback
by the side of an ox which has been
trained for the purpose.</p>

<p>The White-fronted Goose is greatly
esteemed for the excellent quality of
its flesh, which, by those who have
learned to appreciate it, is generally
considered superior to that of any other
species. While the cruel pursuit of
the bird, merely for purpose of sport
ought not to be continued, appreciation
of its value as food may well be encouraged.</p>

<h2>THE TURNSTONE.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HIS small plover-like bird is
found on the sea-coasts of
nearly all countries; in America,
from Greenland and Alaska
to Chili and Brazil; more or less common
in the interior along the shores of
the Great Lakes and larger rivers.</p>

<p>It is generally found in company
with flocks of the smaller species of
Sandpipers, its boldly marked plumage
contrasting with surroundings, while
the Sandpipers mingle with the sands
and unless revealed by some abrupt
movement can hardly be seen at a little
distance.</p>

<p>The name Turnstone has been
applied to this bird on account of its
curious habit of dexterously inserting
its bill beneath stones and pebbles along
the shore in quest of food, overturning
them in search of the insects or prey
of any kind which may be lurking
beneath. It is found on smooth, sandy
beaches, though more commonly about
the base of rocky cliffs and cones.
The eggs of horseshoe crabs are its
particular delight.</p>

<p>In the nesting season the Turnstone
is widely distributed throughout the
northern portions of both continents,
and wanders southward along the sea-coasts
of all countries. In America it
breeds commonly in the Barren Lands
of the Arctic coasts and the Anderson
River districts, on the Islands of
Franklin and Liverpool bays, nesting
in July. In the Hudson&#8217;s Bay country
the eggs are laid in June. The nest is
a hollow scratched in the earth, and is
lined with bits of grass.</p>

<p>The Turnstone is known by various
names: &ldquo;Brant Bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bead-bird,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Horse-foot-Snipe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sand-runner,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Calico-back,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chicaric&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Chickling.&rdquo; The two latter names
have reference to its rasping notes,
&ldquo;Calico-back,&rdquo; to the variegated
plumage of the upper parts.</p>

<p>In summer the adults are oddly pied
above with black, white, brown, and
chestnut-red, but the red is totally
wanting in winter. They differ from
the true Plovers in the well developed
hind-toe, and the strong claws, but
chiefly in the more robust feet, without
trace of web between the toes.</p>

<p>The eggs are greenish-drab in color,
spotted, blotched, and dotted irregularly
and thickly with yellowish and umber
brown. The eggs are two or four,
abruptly pyriform in shape.</p>

<h2>SNOWBIRDS.</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
Along the narrow sandy height<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I watch them swiftly come and go,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or round the leafless wood,</span><br />

Until a little wind upheaves,<br />

<h2>THE BELTED PIPING PLOVER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 39px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="39" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>N the Missouri river region and
in contiguous parts of the
interior of the United States,
the Belted Piping Plover is a
common summer resident, and
is found along the shores of the great
lakes, breeding on the flat, pebbly
beach between the sand dunes and
shore. It is the second of the ring-necked
Plovers, and arrives in April
in scattering flocks, which separate
into pairs a month later. It strays at
times into the interior, and has been
known to breed on the borders of ponds
many miles from the coast. In New
England, however, it seldom wanders
far from the shore, and prefers sand
islands near the main land for its nesting
haunts. Nelson says, that some
thirty pairs, which were breeding
along the beach at Waukegan, within
a space of two miles, successfully concealed
their nests, for which he made
diligent search, although the birds
were continually circling about or
standing at a short distance, uttering
an occasional note of alarm.</p>

<p>These birds have a soft, low, piping
note, which they utter not only upon
the wing, but occasionally as they run
about upon the ground, and, during
the early nesting season, a peculiar,
loud, prolonged, musical call, that
readily attracts attention. In other
respects, their habits are not noticeably
differed from the Semi-palmated.
(See July <span class="smcap">Birds</span>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30523/30523-h/30523-h.htm#Page_8">8</a>.)</p>

<p>Their nests are without lining, a
mere depression in the sand. The
eggs are usually four, light gray to
creamy buff, finely and rather sparsely
speckled or dotted with blackish brown
and purplish gray.</p>

<p>The female Belted Piping Plover is
similar to the male, but with the dark
colors lighter and less in extent. The
young have no black band in front,
while the collar around the neck is
ashy brown.</p>

<p>These interesting and valuable game
birds are found associated with various
beach birds and Sandpipers, and they
become exceedingly fat during the
latter part of the summer.</p>

<p>All the Plovers have a singular
habit when alighting on the ground
in the nesting time; they drop their
wings, stand with their legs half bent,
and tremble as if unable to support
their bodies. In this absurd position
they will stand, according to a well-known
observer, for several minutes,
uttering a curious sound, and then
seem to balance themselves with great
difficulty. This singular man&oelig;uvre is
no doubt intended to produce a belief
that they may be easily caught, and
thus turn the attention of the egg-gatherer
from the pursuit of the eggs
to themselves, their eggs being
recognized the world over, as a great
delicacy.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
The Plover utters a piping sound<br />
While on the wing or on the ground;<br />
All a tremble it drops its wings,<br />
And, with legs half bent, it sings:<br />
&ldquo;My nest is near, come take the eggs,<br />
And take me too,&mdash;I&#8217;m off my legs.&rdquo;<br />
In vain men search with eager eyes,<br />
No nest is found, the Plover flies!<br />

<h2>THE WILD TURKEY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 39px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="39" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>T has been observed that when
the Turkey makes its appearance
on table all conversation
should for the moment be
suspended. That it is eaten in
silence on some occasions may be
inferred from the following anecdote:
A certain judge of Avignon, famous
for his love of the glorious bird, which
the American people have wisely
selected for the celebration of Thanksgiving
Day, said to a friend: &ldquo;We
have just been dining on a superb
Turkey. It was excellent. Stuffed
with truffles to the very throat&mdash;tender,
delicate, filled with perfume! We
left nothing but the bones!&rdquo; &ldquo;How
many were there of you?&rdquo; asked his
friend. &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; replied the judge,
&ldquo;the Turkey&mdash;and myself!&rdquo; The
reason, no doubt, why this brilliant
bird, which so much resembles the
domestic Turkey, is now almost extinct.
It was formerly a resident of
New England, and is still found to
some extent as far north-west as the
Missouri River and south-west as
Texas. In Ohio it was formerly an
abundant resident. Dr. Kirtland
(1850) mentions the time when Wild
Turkeys were more common than
tame ones are now.</p>

<p>The nests of this bird are very
difficult to discover, as they are made
on the ground, midst tall, thick weeds
or tangled briars. The female will
not leave the nest until almost trodden
upon. It is stated that when the eggs
are once touched, she will abandon
her nest.</p>

<p>The Turkey became known to
Europeans almost immediately upon
the discovery of America by the
Spaniards in 1518, and it is probable
that it is distinctively an American
bird. In its wild state, its plumage,
as in the case of the Honduras Turkey,
grows more lustrous and magnificent
as the family extends southward.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Gobblers,&rdquo; as the males are
called, associate in parties of ten to
one hundred, seeking their food apart
from the females, which wander singly
with their young or in troops with
other hens and their families, sometimes
to the number of seventy or
eighty. They travel on foot, unless
disturbed by the hunter or a river
compels them to take wing. It is
said that when about to cross a river,
they select a high eminence from
which to start, that their flight may
be more sure, and in such a position
they sometimes remain for a day or
more, as if in consultation. On such
occasions the males gobble vociferously,
strutting about pompously as if to
animate their companions. At the
signal note of their leader, they wing
their way to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>The Wild Turkey feeds on many
kinds of berries, fruits, and grasses.
Beetles, tadpoles, young frogs, and
lizards are sometimes found in its
crop. When the Turkeys reach
their destination, they disperse in
flocks, devouring the mast as they
proceed.</p>

<p>Pairing time begins in March. The
sexes roost apart, but at no great
distance, so that when the female
utters a call, every male within hearing
responds, rolling note after note in
rapid succession, in a voice resembling
that of the tame Turkey when he
hears any unusual noise. Where the
Turkeys are numerous, the woods
from one end to the other, sometimes
for many miles, resound with these
voices of wooing.</p>

<p>The specimen of the Wild Turkey
presented in this number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> is
of extraordinary size and beauty, and
has been much admired. The day is
not far distant when a living specimen
of this noble bird will be sought for in
vain in the United States.</p>

<h2>THE CERULEAN WARBLER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HIS beautiful little sky-blue
feathered creature is well
named Azure Warbler, or
again White-throated Blue
Warbler, and is the most abundant of
the genus here.</p>

<p>It is a bird of the wood, everywhere
associated with the beautiful tall forests
of the more northern counties of
western New York, sometimes found
in the open woods of pasture-lands,
and quite partial to hardwood trees.
In its flitting motion in search of insect-prey,
and in the jerking curves of
its more prolonged flight, as also in
its structure, it is a genuine Wood
Warbler and keeps for the most part
to what Thoreau calls the &ldquo;upper story&rdquo;
of its sylvan domain.</p>

<p>All Warblers, it has been said, depend
upon their markings rather
than song for their identity, which
renders the majority of the tribe of
greater interest to the scientist than
to the novice. Until you have named
four or five of the commonest species
as landmarks, you will be considerably
confused.</p>

<p>Audubon described the song of the
Cerulean Warbler as &ldquo;extremely sweet
and mellow,&rdquo; whereas it is a modest
little strain, says Chapman, or trill,
divided into syllables like <em>zee, zee, zee,
ze-ee-ee-eep</em>, or according to another
observer, <em>rheet, rheet, rheet, rheet, ridi,
idi, e-e-e-e-ee</em>; beginning with several
soft warbling notes and ending in a
rather prolonged but quite musical
squeak. The latter and more rapid
part of the strain, which is given in
the upward slide, approaches an insect
quality of tone which is more or less
peculiar to all true Warblers, a song
so common as to be a universal characteristic
of our tall forests.</p>

<p>It is not strange that the nest of this
species has been so seldom discovered,
even where the bird is very abundant
during the breeding season. It is
built in the higher horizontal branches
of forest trees, always out some distance
from the trunk, and ranging from
twenty to fifty feet above the ground.
One described by Dr. Brewer, found in
Ontario, near Niagara Falls, was built
in a large oak tree at the height of
fifty or more feet from the ground.
It was placed horizontally on the
upper surface of a slender limb between
two small twigs; and the branch
on which it was thus saddled was only
an inch and a half in thickness, being
nine feet from the trunk of the
tree. The abandoned home was secured
with great difficulty.</p>

<p>The nest is a rather slender fabric,
somewhat similar to the nest of the
Redstart, and quite small for the bird,
consisting chiefly of a strong rim firmly
woven of strips of fine bark, stems of
grasses, and pine needles, bound round
with flaxen fibres of plants and wool.
Around the base a few bits of hornets&#8217;
nests, mosses, and lichens are loosely
fastened. The nest within is furnished
with fine stems and needles, the
flooring very thin and slight.</p>

<p>The bird is shy when started from
the nest, and has a sharp chipping
alarm-note common to the family.</p>

<p>The Cerulean Warbler is found in
the Eastern States, but is more numerous
west of the Allegheny mountains,
and throughout the heavily
wooded districts of the Mississippi valley.
In winter it migrates to Central
America and Cuba. The Warblers
are of unfailing interest to the lover of
bird life. Apart from the beauty of
the birds themselves, with their perpetually
contrasting colors among the
green leaves, their pretty ways furnish
to the silent watcher an ever changing
spectacle of the innocent life in the
tree-tops.</p>

<h2>THE WILD TURKEY.</h2>


<p>I thought my picture would
appear in this number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>.
What would Thanksgiving be
without a Turkey, I&#8217;d like to
know.</p>

<p>The editor says that I am a
bird of ex-tra-or-di-na-ry size
and beauty. That word is as
big as I am, but by spelling it, I
guess you will understand.</p>

<p>I look as proud as a peacock,
don&#8217;t I? Well, I am just as
proud. You ought to see me
strut, and hear me talk when
the hen-turkeys are around.
Why, sometimes when there is
a large troop of us in the woods
you can hear us <em>gobble, gobble,
gobble</em>, for many miles. We are
so fond of talking to each other.</p>

<p>That is when we are about to
set up housekeeping, you think.</p>

<p>Yes, in March and April.
After the nests are made, and
the little turkeys hatched out,
we big, handsome fellows go off
by ourselves. The hen-turkeys,
with their young broods, do the
same.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are as many
as a hundred in our troop and
seventy or eighty in theirs. We
travel on foot, picking up food
as we go, till we meet a man
with a gun, or come to a wide
river.</p>

<p>Then we have to fly.</p>

<p>In a flock? Oh, yes. We
choose some high place from
which to get a good start.
There we all stay, sometimes a
day or two, strutting about and
talking big. It is <em>gobble, gobble
gobble</em>, from morning till night.
Just like one of your conventions,
you know. After awhile
our leader gives the signal and
off we all fly to the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>Did you ever see one of our
nests? No? Well, they are
not easily seen, though they are
made on the ground. You see,
we are cunning and build them
among tall, thick weeds and
tangled briars.</p>

<p>I hope, if you ever come
across one, you will not touch it,
because my mate would never
return to it again, if you did.</p>

<p>What do we eat?</p>

<p>Berries, fruit and grasses,
beetles, tadpoles, frogs and
lizards. In fact anything we
consider good.</p>

<h2>THE YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 39px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="39" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>N appearance this bird resembles
a large Tern (see Vol. I, page <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30103/30103-h/30103-h.htm#Page_103">103</a>),
and its habits are similar
to those of the Terns. Inter-tropical,
it is of a wandering disposition,
breeding on the islands of
mid-ocean thousands of miles apart.
It is noted for its elegant, airy,
and long-protracted flight. Davie says
that on Bourbon, Mauritius and other
islands east and south of Madagascar
it breeds in the crevices of the rocks
of inaccessible cliffs, and in hollow
trees. In the Bermuda Islands it nests
about the first of May in holes in high
rocky places along the shores. Here
its favorite resorts are the small islands
of Great Sound, Castle Harbor, and
Harrington Sound. The Phaeton, as
it is felicitously called, nests in the
Bahamas in holes in the perpendicular
faces of cliffs and on the flat surfaces
of rocks. A single egg is laid, which
has a ground-color of purplish brownish
white, covered in some specimens
almost over the entire surface with
fine reddish chocolate-colored spots.</p>

<p>These species compose the small but
distinct family of tropic birds and are
found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical
regions of the world. Long
journeys are made by them across the
open sea, their flight when emigrating
being strong, rapid, and direct, and
immense distances are covered by them
as they course undismayed by wind or
storm. In feeding, Chapman says,
they course over the water, beating
back and forth at a height of about
forty feet, and their long willowy tail-feathers
add greatly to the grace and
beauty of their appearance when on
the wing. They are of rare and
probably accidental occurrence on our
coasts.</p>

<h2>THE YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD.</h2>


<p>The people who make a study
of birds say that I look like a
large Tern, and that my habits
are like his.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether that is
so, I am sure, for I have no
acquaintance with that bird, but
you little folks can turn to your
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30103/30103-h/30103-h.htm">March</a> number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> and see
for yourselves if it is true.</p>

<p>For my part, I think I am the
prettier of the two on account of
my long, willowy tail-feathers.
They add greatly, it is said, to
the grace and beauty of my
appearance when on the wing.
Then, the color of my coat is
much more beautiful than his, I
think, don&#8217;t you think so, too?</p>

<p>We are not so common as the
Terns, either, for they are very
numerous. There are only three
species of our family, so we
consider ourselves quite distinct.</p>

<p>What are we noted for?</p>

<p>Well, principally for our long
distance flights across the sea,
elegant and airy, as the writers
say of us. Maybe that is the
reason they call us the Phaeton
sometimes.</p>

<p>Do we go north in the summer
as so many other birds do?</p>

<p>Ugh! You make me shudder.
No, indeed! We never go
farther north than Florida. Our
home, or where we build our
nests, is in the tropical and sub-tropical
regions, where the
weather is very warm, you know.</p>

<p>We are great wanderers and
build our nests on islands, way
out in the ocean many thousands
of miles apart.</p>

<p>In trees?</p>

<p>Oh, no, but in any hole we see
in the face of a great rock or
cliff, and sometimes right on the
top of a rock.</p>

<p>How many eggs?</p>

<p>Only one. That is the reason,
you see, that our family remains
small.</p>

<p>Sing?</p>

<p>Oh, my, no! We are not singing
birds. We have a call-note,
though harsh and guttural,
which sounds like <em>tip, tip, tip</em>.</p>

<h2>THE EUROPEAN KINGFISHER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 91px;">
<img src="images/imgr.png" width="91" height="80" alt="R" title="" />
</div>
<p>ARELY indeed is this charming
bird now found in England, where
formerly it could
be seen darting hither and
thither in most frequented
places. Of late years, according to
Dixon, he has been persecuted so
greatly, partly by the collector, who
never fails to secure the brilliant
creature for his cabinet at every opportunity,
and partly by those who have
an inherent love for destroying every
living object around them. Gamekeepers,
too, are up in arms against
him, because of his inordinate love of
preying on the finny tribe. Where the
Kingfisher now is seen is in the most
secluded places, the author adds,
where the trout streams murmur
through the silent woods, but seldom
trod by the foot of man; or in the
wooded gullies down which the stream
from the mountains far above rushes
and tumbles over the huge rocks, or
lies in pools smooth as the finest mirror.</p>

<p>The Kingfisher is comparatively a
silent bird, though he sometimes utters
a few harsh notes as he flies swift as a
meteor through the wooded glades.
You not unfrequently flush the Kingfisher
from the holes in the banks, and
amongst the brambles skirting the
stream. He roosts at night in holes,
usually the nesting cavity. Sometimes
he will alight on stumps and branches
projecting from the water, and sit quiet
and motionless, but on your approach
he darts quickly away, often uttering
a feeble <em>seep, seep</em>, as he goes.</p>

<p>The habits of the English Kingfisher
are identical with those of the
American, though the former is the
more brilliant bird in plumage.
(See <span class="smcap">Birds</span>, Vol. I, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30626/30626-h/30626-h.htm#Page_61">61</a>.) The ancients
had a very absurd idea as to its nesting
habits. They believed that the bird
built a floating nest, and whenever the
old bird and her charge were drifted
by the winds, as they floated over the
briny deep, the sea remained calm.
He was, therefore, to the ancient
mariner, a bird held sacred in the
extreme. Even now these absurd
superstitions have not wholly disappeared.
For instance, the nest is
said to be made of the fish bones ejected
by the bird, while the real facts are,
that they not only nest but roost in
holes, and it must follow that vast
quantities of rejected fish bones
accumulate, and on these the eggs are
of necessity laid.</p>

<p>These eggs are very beautiful
objects, being of a deep pinkish hue,
usually six in number.</p>

<p>The food of the Kingfisher is not
composed entirely of fish, the remains
of fresh-water shrimps being found in
their stomachs, and doubtless other
animals inhabiting the waters are from
time to time devoured.</p>

<p>The English Kingfisher, says Dixon,
remains throughout the year, but
numbers perish when the native
streams are frozen. There is, perhaps,
not a bird in all the ranks of the
feathered gems of equatorial regions,
be it ever so fair, the Humming-bird
excepted, that can boast a garb so
lovely as this little creature of the
northland. Naturalists assert that the
sun has something to do with the
brilliant colors of the birds and insects
of the tropics, but certainly, the Kingfisher
is an exception of the highest
kind. Alas, that he has no song to
inspire the muse of some English bard!</p>

<h2>THE EUROPEAN KINGFISHER.</h2>


<p>Little Folks:</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have liked it one
bit if my picture had been left
out of this beautiful book. My
cousin, the American Kingfisher,
had his in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30626/30626-h/30626-h.htm">February</a> number,
and I find he had a good deal
to say about himself in his letter,
too.</p>

<p>Fine feathers make fine birds,
they say. Well, if that is true,
I must be a very fine bird, for
surely my feathers are gay
enough to please anybody&mdash;<em>I</em>
think.</p>

<p>To see me in all my beauty,
you must seek me in my native
wood. I look perfectly gorgeous
there, flitting from tree to tree.
Or maybe you would rather see
me sitting on a stump, gazing
down into the clear pool which
looks like a mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a vain bird!&rdquo; you
would say; &ldquo;see him looking
at himself in the water;&rdquo; when
all the time I had my eye on a
fine trout which I intended to
catch for my dinner.</p>

<p>Well, though I wear a brighter
dress than my American cousin,
our habits are pretty much alike.
I am sure he catches fish the
same way I do&mdash;when he is hungry.</p>

<p>With a hook and line, as you do?</p>

<p>Oh, no; with my bill, which is
long, you observe, and made for
that very purpose. You should
just see me catch a fish! Down
I fly to a stump near the brook,
or to a limb of a tree which
overhangs the water, and there
I sit as quiet as a mouse for
quite a while.</p>

<p>Everything being so quiet, a
fine speckled trout, or a school
of troutlets, play near the surface.
Now is my chance! Down
I swoop, and up I come with a
fish crosswise in my bill.</p>

<p>Back I go to my perch, toss
the minnow into the air, and as
it falls catch it head first and
swallow it whole. I tell you
this because you ought to know
why I am called <em>Kingfisher</em>.</p>

<p>Do we swallow bones and all?</p>

<p>Yes, but we afterwards eject
the bones, when we are resting
or roosting in our holes in the
banks of the stream. That must
be the reason people who write
about us say we build our nests
of fish bones.</p>

<p>Sing?</p>

<p>Oh, no, we are not singing
birds; but sometimes, when flying
swiftly through the air, we
give a harsh cry that nobody
but a bird understands.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20em;">

<h2>THE VERMILION FLY-CATCHER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HICKETS along water courses
are favorite resorts of this
beautiful Fly-catcher, which
may be seen only on the
southern border of the United States,
south through Mexico to Guatemala,
where it is a common species. Mr.
W. E. D. Scott notes it as a common
species about Riverside, Tucson, and
Florence, Arizona. Its habits are
quite similar to those of other Fly-catchers,
though it has not been so
carefully observed as its many cousins
in other parts of the country. During
the nesting season, the male frequently
utters a twittering song while poised
in the air, in the manner of the
Sparrow Hawk, and during the song
it snaps its bill as if catching insects.</p>

<p>The Vermilion&#8217;s nest is usually
placed in horizontal forks of ratana
trees, and often in mesquites, not more
than six feet from the ground; they are
composed of small twigs and soft
materials felted together, with the
rims covered with lichens, and the
shallow cavity lined with a few
horse or cow hairs. Dr. Merrill states
that they bear considerable resemblance
to nests of the Wood Pewee in appearance
and the manner in which they
are saddled to the limb. Nests have
been found, however, which lacked
the exterior coating of lichens.</p>

<p>Three eggs are laid of a rich
creamy-white with a ring of large
brown and lilac blotches at the larger end.</p>

<h2>THE LAZULI BUNTING.</h2>

<p>N Colorado and Arizona the
Lazuli Painted Finch, as it is
called, is common, while in
California it is very abundant,
being, in fact, generally distributed
throughout the west, and
along the Pacific Coast it is found as
far north as Puget Sound, during the
summer. Davie says it replaces the
Indigo Bunting,
(See <span class="smcap">Birds</span>, Vol. I, page <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25983/25983-h/25983-h.htm#Page_174">174</a>,)
from the Plains to the
Pacific, being found in all suitable
localities. The nest is usually built
in a bush or in the lower limbs of trees,
a few feet from the ground. Fine
strips of bark, small twigs, grasses, and
hair are used in preparing it for the
four tiny, light bluish-green eggs,
which readily fade when exposed to
light. The eggs so closely resemble
those of the Bluebird as not to be
distinguishable with certainty. The
nest is an inartistic one for a bird of
gay plumage.</p>

<p>From Florence A. Merriam&#8217;s charming
book, &ldquo;A-Birding on a Bronco,&rdquo;
we select a description of the pretty
manners of this attractive bird. She
says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While waiting for the Woodpeckers,
one day, I saw a small
brownish bird flying busily back and
forth to some green weeds. She was
joined by her mate, a handsome blue
Lazuli Bunting, even more beautiful
than our lovely Indigo, and he flew
beside her full of life and joy. He lit
on the side of a cockle stem, and on
the instant caught sight of me. Alas!
he seemed suddenly turned to stone.
He held onto that stalk as if his little
legs had been bars of iron and I a
devouring monster. When he had
collected his wits enough to fly off,
instead of the careless gay flight with
which he had come out through the
open air, he timidly kept low within
the cockle field, making a circuitous
way through the high stalks. He
could be afraid of me if he liked, I
thought, for after a certain amount of
suspicion, an innocent person gets
resentful; at any rate I was going to
see that nest. Creeping up cautiously
when the mother bird was away, so as
not to scare her, and carefully parting
the mallows, I looked in. Yes, there
it was, a beautiful little sage-green
nest of old grass laid in a coil. I felt
as pleased as if having a right to share
the family happiness. After that I
watched the small worker gather
material with new interest, knowing
where she was going to put it. She
worked fast, but did not take the first
thing she found, by any means. With
a flit of the wing she went in nervous
haste from cockle to cockle, looking
eagerly about her. Jumping down to
the ground, she picked up a bit of
grass, threw it down dissatisfied, and
turned away like a person looking for
something. At last she lit on the side
of a thistle, and tweaking out a fibre,
flew with it to the nest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A month after the first encounter
with the father Lazuli, I found him
looking at me around the corner of a
cockle stalk, and in passing back
again, caught him singing full tilt,
though his bill was full of insects!
After we had turned our backs I looked
over my shoulder and had the satisfaction
of seeing him take his beakful
to the nest. You couldn&#8217;t help admiring
him, for though not a warrior who
would snap his bill over the head of
an enemy of his home, he had a gallant
holiday air with his blue coat and
merry song, and you felt sure his little
brown mate would get cheer and
courage enough from his presence to
make family dangers appear less frightful.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE LAZULI BUNTING.</h2>


<p>You think you have seen me
before? Well, I must admit my
relative, the Indigo Bunting, and
I <em>do</em> look alike. They say
though, I am the prettier bird of
the two. Turn to your May number, page <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25983/25983-h/25983-h.htm#Page_174">174</a>,
and decide for yourselves.</p>

<p>I live farther west than he
does. You find him in the
eastern and middle states. Then
he disappears and I take his
place, all the way from the Great
Plains to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Some people call me the
Lazuli Painted Finch. That&#8217;s
funny, for I never painted anything
in my life&mdash;not even my
cheeks. Would you like to know
how my mate and I go to housekeeping?
A lady who visits
California, where I live, will tell
you all about it. She rides a
horse called Mountain Billy.
He will stand still under a tree
so that she can peep into nests
and count the eggs, when the
mother bird is away.</p>

<p>She can travel a good many
miles in that way, and meet lots
of birds. She says in her book,
that she has got acquainted with
seventy-five families, without
robbing one nest, or doing the
little creatures any harm.</p>

<p>Well, one day this lady saw a
brownish bird flying busily back
and forth to some tall green
weeds. After a while a handsome
blue Bunting flew along
side of her, full of life and joy.</p>

<p>That was my mate and I.
How frightened I was! for our
nest was in those green weeds
and not very far from the
ground. I flew away as soon as
I could pluck up courage, but
not far, so that I could watch
the lady and the nest. How my
heart jumped when I saw her
creep up, part the weeds and
look in. All she saw was a few
twigs and a sage-green nest of
old grass laid in a coil. My
mate hadn&#8217;t put in the lining
yet; you see it takes her quite a
while to get the thistle down and
the hair and strips of bark for
the inside. The next time the
lady passed, the house was done
and my mate was sitting on the
nest. She just looked down at
us from the back of Mountain
Billy and passed on.</p>

<p>Four weeks after, she came
again, and there I was, flying
about and singing &ldquo;like a bird,&rdquo;
my mouth full of insects, too. I
waited &#8217;till she had turned away
before I flew to the nest to feed
our little ones. I didn&#8217;t know,
you see, that she was such a
good friend of ours, or I
wouldn&#8217;t have been so afraid.</p>
